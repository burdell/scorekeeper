This is a very new, and very work-in-progress library for general baseball scorekeeping! It currently handles all the data generation for [Scorebook](https://www.scorebook.biz). I'm working on making it into its own library to also be used an interactive scorekeeping app. If any of that sounds interesting and cool and you want to help in any way, free free to contact me!
